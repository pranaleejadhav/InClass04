iOS Table Views, Concurrency, and Passing data between ViewControllers

Part 1 : Password Setup View Controller 


1.This  interface  enables  the  user  to  select  the  number  of  passwords  to  be  generated and  the  length  of  these  passwords.This  view  controller  should  be  embedded  in  a navigation controller to provide the transition to the Passwords list View Controller. 

2.Upon  clicking  the  “Create  Passwords”  button,  the  app  should  check  it  the  user  has entered  a  valid  number  of  passwords  and  has  selected  a  strength  level  (length).  If any  input  is  missing,  you  should  display  an  alert  dialog  indicating  the  error.  Else transition to the Passwords list ViewController and pass the required data. 

Part 2 : Password Setup View Controller 
The requirements are as follows: 

1.This  view  controller  should  generate  the  passwords  list  which  should  be  created  in the background in a child thread. Then the result should be passed to the main thread and displayed in the Table View and shown in the figure. 

2.Upon selecting a password from the list, the view controller should transition back to the  previous  view  controller  and  display  the  selected  password  in  the  Password Setup view controller.
